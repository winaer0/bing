Bing, sometimes also referred to as Bing Search, is a search engine developed by Microsoft and primarily known for being a search engine website accessible by visiting Bing.com.

While Bing is still mostly known for its search engine website, that's not the only way you can access its web searching services. Those who want to use Bing can also use it via Microsoft Edge, as well as through the Bing mobile app.

In Edge, Bing is automatically accessible when you perform a web search using Edge's search bar, since it's the browser's default search engine. So, when you perform a search in Edge using the search bar, you'll be taken directly to Bing's search results.

## History of Bing

Bing, search engine launched in 2009 by the American software company Microsoft Corporation.

Microsoft’s previous search engine, Live Search, from the time of its release in 2006 consistently trailed well behind those of Google Inc., the industry giant, and the Internet portal site of Yahoo! Inc. Microsoft hoped to change the dynamics of the search-engine market with the release of Bing, a “decision engine” designed to display more retrieved information in search pages than was typical, thus enabling better-informed decisions concerning what links to follow or even, in some cases, displaying enough information to satisfy the original query. Bing also displayed related searches and the user’s previous searches on the left side of the page.

In July 2009 an agreement was reached in which Yahoo! would use Bing to power search on its portal site and would provide the sales force to work with companies that sought to do special campaigns on Bing. The Microsoft-Yahoo! arrangement was scheduled to last for 10 years, and Bing largely powered Yahoo! Search across the globe from 2012. In February 2010 the social networking site Facebook—which had more than 400 million users and was the second most-visited Web site after Google—made an agreement with Microsoft to present Bing results to users searching the World Wide Web from within Facebook. Although Bing’s market share was initially somewhat slow to gain on that of Google or Yahoo!, the search engine eventually became the second largest in the United States; however, Google remained the dominant search engine, with Bing drawing only a few percent of the market.

## Mobile Searching With the Bing Search App

If you think you'll need to do most of your web searching on a mobile device, give the Bing Search app a try. The Bing Search app is available for both Android and iOS devices.

The search engine aspect of the app still provides the same quality of search results as Bing's main desktop website, but Bing's mobile app offers a few notable features like Near Me, Fun, and Gas:

* Near Me: Tap this and Bing will automatically populate a list of highly rated restaurants near you and a list of local attractions to visit.
* Fun: Bing will display a number of fun mobile-friendly games and quizzes you can occupy your time with.
* Gas: Bing will automatically generate a list of the closest gas stations with their address and the most updated gasoline prices.

Bing and Google may be the most well-known search engines around but they're certainly not the only ones. There are other great web search engines like DuckDuckGo and Dogpile that are more than up to the task.
